<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <ul>
        <li>5 tablespoons butter </li>

        <li>â…” cup milk </li>
        <li>Sea salt </li>
        <li>Freshly grated nutmeg </li>
        <li>4 1/3-inch-thick slices country bread</li>

        <li>2 thin slices Gruyere cheese </li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
    </ul>
</ul>


<h2>Directions</h2>

<h3>Prep the Sauce</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat a two-sided electric griddle on medium-high to high for about 20 minutes, or preheat the oven to 300 degrees and preheat a cast-iron skillet on top of the stove for about 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Prepare a bechamel sauce: in a small saucepan over medium heat, melt 1 tablespoon butter.</li>
    <li>When bubbles have subsided, add flour and whisk vigorously for 1 minute.</li>
    <li>Slowly whisk in milk until smooth. Bring to a boil, and cook until thick.</li>
    <li>Remove from heat, and season to taste with salt and nutmeg.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Prep the Bread</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Spread two slices of bread generously with sauce.</li>
    <li>Lay two slices of ham on top of each, and top each with a slice of cheese; ham and cheese should slightly overlap edges of bread.</li>
    <li>Top each with a slice of bread.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Brown the Sandwich</h3>
<ol>
    <li>In a small saucepan, melt remaining the 4 tablespoons butter.
    <li>Brush the sandwiches on both sides with butter, making sure that the edges are well covered. </li>
    <li>If you're using a griddle, place cheese side down, close the griddle and cook until the bread is toasted dark and cheese is leaking out and bubbling.
        <br/>If you're using a skillet, place sandwiches cheese side down and cook on stove top until well browned, then turn and brown again.</li>
    <li>Transfer skillet to oven, and bake until heated through and cheese is bubbling. </li>
    <li>Meanwhile, fry the eggs in a skillet with little butter. </li>
</ol>

<h3>Serve</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Slide one fried egg onto each sandwich. </li>
    <li>Serve hot.</li>
</ol>
